<h1> Coping with Expectations of First Day of High School  </h1>
    <br> 
    <!--Below is coding for paragrpah text -->
    <p> The first day of high school is always a daunting time for students because it is all about walking into the unexpected of what is going to happen over the next 5 years. From my personal experience I will be providing what is expected of students on the first day of school and also tips on how to cope with the first day. The day normally starts off getting up earlier then usual because you couldn't sleep the night before because off all the nerves going into high school, once your up you get ready and check your backpack several times to make sure you don't forget anything then you're off to school. During the car ride your mum is trying to calm your nerves and distract you but its not working and you go silent. Once you arrive at high school it hits you that you are here and have arrived. This is how my experience getting to high school was and the constant nerves I felt being at a new school and not knowing what is next was probably the most nervous thing. When you come to a new school there will always be nervous because that is a natural thing for us to do and it shows that we care about what is happening but coming to high school, all students are going to feel some sort of nerves which should be expected as it is a big change going from Intermediate to High School and changing schools but it's important for students to understand that they are not alone and everyone around them is feeling the same way even if they aren't showing it to be obvious to others. </p>

     <p> Everyone's first day experience will be different going to high school but I have some information on the basics of what students can expect on the first day of high school. At most high school you will start in a hall where the principal and other staff will address you and welcome you to the school. This normally lasts around 30 minutes once everyone has spoken but varies depending on how many people speak. From my experience it lasted around 30minutes. Once this part is over then normally they will divide students into classes which from my experience was  called a form class which is where you go every morning before the first period class. Most schools have a similar idea with a form class for their students. Once you have got to your class and got to know each other then you will do activities and some games to get to know eachother better. On the first day of my high school experience, it was only the year 9’s in school which they called our ‘Orientation day’. A Lot of schools do this as a way for new students to get use to the school for the next day when they have classes. During this day the students will also get there timetable of their subjects and get a tour around the school and shown where all of there classes are. The first day for students going into high school is all about the students getting used to school and settling in.   </p>

    <p> With the first day of high school, it is a very nervous time for all students. From my personal experience I will be recommending ways on how to cope with the expectations of the first day of high school. When going into the first day of high school, the first bit of advice that I can give to make it easier on how to cope with the first day of school is to not stress about it. With the first day of high school it is all about the students getting used to the school and knowing where things are and meeting new people. I found that the first day of high school was nerve racking to start with but once you know what is going to happen during the day it becomes less stressful and a much easier and fun day taking in the experience. My main advice is to not stress out for the first day of high school because it is all about a new learning experience.  The next bit of advice I can give is that it is really important that for the first day of school you get a good night sleep and rest the night before and wake up fresh and ready to go for the first day of high school. This leads on to ensure that before you get to school, you have a good breakfast as you are going to need a lot of energy on the first day of high school as there is a lot of information that you will be given. To make the day less stressful for the students, leave school earlier than what you would want to because you don’t want to be rushing into school after the bell rings as that will be a stressful time for the students and not make the experience as fun as it could be as well arriving early also give the students a chance to chat with other students while they wait and potentially make some new friends which will help ease the nerves. </p>

    <p>High School is unlike any experience that you have ever done before. It is a new exciting opportunity for students to meet new people, get involved in activities, further their learning and so many more opportunities that come in high school. The best advice that I can offer students on their first day of high school is to take it all in as you are never going to experience this opportunity again.  As much as going to high school can be a daunting time it is also a new and exciting opportunity that students should embrace. Throughout my 5 years at high school I really wish that I embraced the experience more because you only get to go to high school once and you only get that first day experience once and the best advice from personal experience going through that first day is to embrace everything that comes to you and enjoy the time because you will only get one first day of high school ever and it should be a time that students enjoy and embrace.  </p>
