<h1> High School Guide  </h1>

        <!--Below is coding for paragrpah text -->
    <p> In my website which is called High School Guide the basics of my website is about providing a guide for students who are going into high school. In my website there will be five different pages which all have a different purpose of helping students prepare for high school and make the transaction easier for them from Intermediate to High School. For the five different pages in my website, they will include a homepage called ‘High School Guide’ which will explain what the website is about and the purpose of creating it. The next page in my website is ‘Tips for High School’. On this page it will include tips for high school that is going to make it easier for students in high school. These tips can include what I have learnt in my time of being in high school and wanting to share them with students going into high school. The next page that I will be including in my website is called ‘Coping with Expectations of First Day of High School’. On this page it will include information on what to expect on the first day of high school which will come from personal experiences and another section on how to cope with the first day of high school. This will also come from personal experiences. The fourth page that I will be including in my website is called ‘Expectations for High School’. On this page it will include information on general expectations of high school and then more specific expectations for each year level. The last page in my website called ‘Ways to Settle into High School’ will include information on the many ways to settle into high school and make it easier for students to make the transition from Intermediate to High School which will come from personal experiences of the different ways to settle into high school. </p>

    <p> As part of creating this website. I have chosen the idea of a ‘High School Guide’ because when I was coming to High School in year 9, I had no clue what to expect or how to prepare myself for such a big move from Intermediate to High School and I struggled a lot with making that transition which from my experience, I want to create this website to be able to help students make the transition a much easier process and less stressful for them as from personal experience it is a very daunting  and stressful time coming to High School which has given me the passion to create a website that is going to be able students coming to high school much easier for them. When I was deciding what website I wanted to create, I wanted to create a website that was going to make an impact and help people. I find the idea of a High School Guide a way to help students because when researching different options of websites there was not many websites on the internet like mine which gives me the opportunity to create a website that is going to create a positive impact on students' lives and help them in their journey of starting high school.  </p>
